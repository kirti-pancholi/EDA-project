The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and EDA. For this project:

Objective: To explore the Iris dataset, analyze the relationships among its features, and identify patterns or clusters within its three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).

Steps:

Data Overview: Understand the structure (150 rows, 5 columns).

Data Cleaning: Ensure no missing values or errors.

Visualization: Use scatterplots, histograms, and pairplots to visualize relationships (e.g., SepalLength vs. SepalWidth).

Key Insights: Notable separations between species in feature spaces, with clear clustering for Setosa.

Conclusion: The dataset is clean, shows clear relationships, and is suitable for classification tasks.
